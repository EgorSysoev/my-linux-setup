<h1>EFFECTIVE JAVA</h1>

<hr />

<h2>CREATING AND DESTROYING OBJECTS:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Consider static factory methods instead of Constructors:
<ul>
<li>They have names.</li>
<li>They are not required to create a new object each time they're invoked.</li>
<li>They can return an object of any subtype of their return type.</li>
<li>Classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.</li>
<li>They are not readily distinguishable from other static methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters.</li>
<li>Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type. 
Single-element enum is the best way to implement a singleton.</li>
<li>Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor.</li>
<li>Avoid finalizers. 
Never do anything time-critical in a finalizer. 
Provide an explicit termination method.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>METHODS COMMON TO ALL OBJECTS:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Obey the general contract when overriding equals.
<ol>
<li>Use the == operator to check if the argument is a reference to this object.</li>
<li>Use the instanceof operator to check if the argument has the correct type.</li>
<li>Cast the argument to correct type.</li>
<li>For each "significant" field in the class, check if that field of the argument matches.</li>
<li>Ask yourself three questions: Is it symmetric? Is it transitive? Is it consistent?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Always override hashcode when you override equals. 
Equal objects must have equal hash codes.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>CLASSES AND INTERFACES: </h2>

<ol>
<li>Minimize the accessibility of classes and members. 
It is wrong for a class to have a public static final array field, or an accessor that returns such a field. Use UnmodifiableList.</li>
<li>Minimize mutability. 
Classes should be immutable unless there's a very good reason to make them mutable. 
Make every field final unless there is a compelling reason to make it nonfinal.</li>
<li>Favor composition over inheritance. 
Inheritance violates encapsulation.</li>
<li>Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it. 
The class must document its self-use of overridable methods. 
Constructors must not involve overridable methods. 
Neither clone nor readObject may invoke an overridable method directly of indirectly.</li>
<li>Prefer interfaces to abstract classes. 
You can combine the virtues of interfaces and abstract classes by providing an abstract skeletal implementation class to go  with each nontrivial interface that you export.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>GENERICS:</h2>

<p>Parametrized type       | List<String>
Actual type parameter   | String
Generic type            | List<E> <br />
Formal type parameter   | E
Unbounded wildcard type | List<?>
Raw type                | List
Bounded type parameter  | <E extends Number>
Recursive type bound    | <T extends Comparable<T>>
Bounded wildcard type   | List<? extends Number>
Generic Method          | static <E> List<E> asList(E[] a)
Type token              | Strung.class</p>

<p>If a type parameter appears only once in a method declaration, replace it with a wildcard.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ENUMS AND ANNOTATIONS:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use EnumSet instead of bit fields.</li>
<li>Use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing.</li>
<li>Emulate extensible enums with interfaces. 
Enums can implement original enums interface and be used in place of original enum.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>METHODS:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Check parameters for validity.</li>
<li>Make defensive copies when needed.
Defensive copies are made before checking the validity of the parameters, and the validity check is performed on the copies.</li>
<li>Return empty arrays or collections, not nulls.</li>
<li>Write doc comments for all exposed API elements. 
Use {a code} for code in doc comments</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>GENERAL PROGRAMMING:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Prefer primitive types to boxed primitives. 
Applying the == operator to boxed primitives is almost always wrong. When you mix primitives and boxed primitives in a single operation, the boxed primitive is auto-unboxed.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>EXCEPTIONS:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programing errors. 
All of the unchecked throwables you implement should subclass RuntimeException.</li>
<li>Favor the use of standard exceptions: IllegalArgumentExceptin, IllegalStateException, NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, ConcurentModificationException, UnsupportedOperationException</li>
<li>Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction. 
Higher layers should catch lower-level exceptions and, in their place, throw exceptions that can be explained in terms of the higher-level abstraction. (Exception translation)</li>
<li>Document all exceptions thrown by each method.</li>
<li>Include failure-capture information in detail messages. 
Should contain all parameters and fields that contributed to the exception.</li>
<li>Strive for failure atomicity. 
A failed method invocation should leave the object in the state that it was in prior to invocation.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>CONCURRENCY:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Synchronize access to shared mutable date. 
Synchronization has no effect unless both read and write operations are synchronized. 
Confine mutable data to a single thread.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive synchronization. 
As a rule, you should do as little work as possible inside synchronized regions.</li>
<li>Prefer executors and tasks to threads.</li>
<li>Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify. 
Use ConcurentHashMap in preference to synchronyzedMap or HashTable. 
For interval timing, always use System.nanoTime in preference to System.currentTimeMillis.</li>
<li>Document thread safety. 
To enable safe concurrent use, a class must clearly document what level of thread safety it supports. 
Levels of thread safety:
    1. Immutable
    2. Unconditionally thread-safe -> No need for external synchronization.
    3. Conditionally thread-safe -> Some methods require external synchronization.
    4. Non thread-safe -> All methods require external synchronization.
    5. Thread hostile.</li>
<li>Use lazy initialization judiciously.</li>
<li>Don't depend on thread scheduler. 
Threads should not run if they are not doing useful work. 
Thread priorities are among the least portable features of the Java platform.</li>
<li>Avoid thread groups. 
Thread groups are obsolete.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>SERIALIZATION:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Implement Serializable judiciously.</li>
<li>Consider using custom serialized form. 
Default serialized form is likely to be appropriate if an object's physical representation is identical to its logical content. 
Even if you decide that the default serialized form is appropriate, you often must provide readObject method to ensure invariants and security.
Before deciding to make a field non-transient, convince yourself that its value is part of the logical state of the object.
You must impose any synchronization on object serialization that you would impose on any other method that reads the entire state of the object.
Declare UID.</li>
<li>Write read Object methods defensively. Defensive copy.</li>
<li>For instance control, prefer enum types to readResolve.</li>
<li>Consider serialization proxies instead of serialized instance.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>NEW COLLECTION INTERFACES IN 6.0:</h2>

<p>Deque -> Double ended queue. (ArrayDeque, LinkedList)
NavigableSet -> SortedSet extended. (TreeSet)
NavigableMap -> SortedMap extended. (TreeMap)</p>
