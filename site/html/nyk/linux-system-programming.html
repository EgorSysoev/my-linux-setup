<h1>LINUX SYSTEM PROGRAMMING</h1>

<p>LINUX ABSTRACTIONS:
1.FILE
2.PROCESS
triplet of the Linux kernel (the heart of
the operating system), the GNU C library (glibc), and the GNU C Compiler</p>

<p>ABI (application binary interface):
Thus, each machine architecture has its
own ABI on Linux. In fact, we tend to call a particular ABI by its machine name, such
as Alpha, or x86-64. Thus, the ABI is a function of both the operating system (say, Linux)
and the architecture (say, x86-64)</p>

<p>SPECIAL FILES:
Linux supports four: block device
files (disk), character device files (keyboard), named pipes, and Unix domain sockets.</p>

<p>INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION:
mechanisms supported by Linux include pipes, named pipes, semaphores, message
queues, shared memory, and futexes.</p>

<p>Modern operating systems provide two fundamental virtualized abstractions to user-space: virtual memory and a virtualized processor.</p>

<p>MEMORY:
Unlike malloc(), which makes no such guarantees about the contents of allocated memory, calloc() zeros all bytes in the returned chunk of memory.</p>

<p>/* like malloc(), but zeros memory and terminates on failure */
void * xmalloc0 (size<em>t size) {
void *p;
p = calloc (1, size);
if (!p) {
perror ("xmalloc0");
exit (EXIT</em>FAILURE);
}
return p;
}</p>

<p>APPROACH  | PROS                            |CONS
----------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------
malloc()  | Easy, simple, common.           |Returned memory not necessarily zeroed.
calloc()  | Makes allocating arrays simple, |Convoluted interface if not allocating arrays.
|   zeros returned memory.          |
realloc() | Resizes existing allocations.   |Useful only for resizing existing allocations.</p>

<p>void free (void *ptr);
A call to free() frees the memory at ptr. The parameter ptr must have been previously
returned by malloc(), calloc(), or realloc(). That is, you cannot use free() to free
partial chunks of memory—say, half of a chunk of memory—by passing in a pointer
halfway into an allocated block</p>
