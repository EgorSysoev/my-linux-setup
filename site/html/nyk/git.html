<p>( ) &lt;--------- ADD - Writes files to the repo. (Into the staging area.)</p>

<h2>|</h2>

<p>+------------+
v            |
HEAD *MASTER &lt;-+- COMMIT - Creates commit object for added files, which
 /         |           has an id, and then puts labels on it [HEAD,
(A) &lt;-------+           MASTER] (or moves them from previous commit).
|                      (Prints branch label that it's advancing and
---                     objects hash)</p>

<p>HEAD  LABEL &lt;---- BRANCH <LABEL> - Stucks a new label on HEAD (withouth
 /                             parameter it prints local branches).
(A)-*MASTER                      (With -r will print remote branches/</p>

<h2>|                              all the references that you have.)</h2>

<p>HEAD *LABEL &lt;---- CHECKOUT <LABEL> - Switches which branch it's going to
 /                               advance at commit (from master to
(A)-MASTER                        label). (If the labels were pointing
|                                to different commits it would also
---                               get the files)</p>

<p>MERGE <LABEL> - Merge contents of <LABEL> branch into
HEAD. Also second <LABEL> parameter
possible -> will merge into it instead
of current branch. There are two
strategys in which git will merge two
branches:</p>

<h2>FAST FORWARD</h2>

<p>If the <LABEL> is reachable from HEAD
and its above it.
LABEL
LABEL         HEAD | *MASTER
|               | /
HEAD (B) *MASTER      (B)
 | /      <em>_</em>    |
(A)          /   (A)
|                |
---              ---</p>

<h2>RECURSIVE STRATEGY</h2>

<p>Merges contents and creates new commit
that has two parents (it can have any
number of parents). Moves currnet branch
and HEAD labels to it (label LABEL stays
behind).
HEAD
|
LABEL HEAD          LABEL  (D)-MASTER
   |                / |
(B)(C)-*MASTER      (B)(C)
| /         <em>_</em>    | /
(A)             /   (A)
|                   |
---                 ---</p>

<p>RESET -hard HEAD^ - Move current label to commit HEAD-1,
and also do checkout (--hard)</p>

<p>LOG --graph --decorate --all - Shows nice history with
graph</p>

<p>TODO graph!        DETACHED HEAD STATE:
TAG v1.0 <hash> -> CHECKOUT v1.0 - If no branch label is
on this commit you get message: "You are in detached
head state", meaning that if you want to keep your
commits, you need to create a new branch.</p>

TO MERGE NEW FEATURE INTO MASTER:</p>

WORKING WITH REMOTE REPOSITORIES:</p>

<p>CLONE <url or path of origin> <optional different name>
- Makes a copy of remote repository. State of our
repo after clone:</p>

<p>+--------------------+----+- TRACKING BRANCHES - they mean: last time I
v ORIGIN/LABEL &lt;-----+    |  talked with origin, thats where its label
ORIGIN/HEAD | ORIGIN/MASTER &lt;-+  was.
|/
HEAD--(D)--*MASTER &lt;------- Also it did not pull over LABEL branch,
/ |                    because it pulls over only the default
(B)(C)                   branch, which is master (note that origin
| /                     and master are just names, they have no
(A)                      segnificance).</p>

<h2>|</h2>

<p>CLONE --bare <url or path of origin> <optional different
name> - Make a copy of repo, containing only
contents of .git directory (there is no
checkout.</p>

<p>REMOTE -v - List remotes (defaultly named origin)</p>

<p>PULL - Same as FETCH + MERGE</p>

<p>PUSH <origin> <local branch> - Pushes changes made to the
local branch to origin repo.</p>
