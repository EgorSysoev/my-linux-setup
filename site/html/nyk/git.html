   v            | <br />
 HEAD *MASTER &lt;-+- COMMIT - Creates commit object for added files, which <br />
     /         |           has an id, and then puts labels on it [HEAD, <br />
    (A) &lt;-------+           MASTER] (or moves them from previous commit). <br />
     |                      (Prints branch label that it's advancing and <br />
    ---                     objects hash)</p>

<p>HEAD  LABEL &lt;---- BRANCH <LABEL> - Stucks a new label on HEAD (withouth <br />
     /                             parameter it prints local branches). 
    (A)-*MASTER                      (With -r will print remote branches/ 
     |                              all the references that you have.)
    ---    </p>

<p>HEAD *LABEL &lt;---- CHECKOUT <LABEL> - Switches which branch it's going to
     /                               advance at commit (from master to
    (A)-MASTER                        label). (If the labels were pointing
     |                                to different commits it would also
    ---                               get the files)</p>

<pre><code>               MERGE &lt;LABEL&gt; - Merge contents of &lt;LABEL&gt; branch into 
                               HEAD. Also second &lt;LABEL&gt; parameter 
                               possible -&gt; will merge into it instead
                               of current branch. There are two
                               strategys in which git will merge two
                               branches:

                               FAST FORWARD
                               ------------
                               If the &lt;LABEL&gt; is reachable from HEAD
                               and its above it.
                                                    LABEL
                                   LABEL         HEAD | *MASTER       
                                     |               | /        
                               HEAD (B) *MASTER      (B)
                                    | /      ___    |
                                    (A)          /   (A)
                                     |                |

                               RECURSIVE STRATEGY
                               ------------------ 
                               Merges contents and creates new commit 
                               that has two parents (it can have any 
                               number of parents). Moves currnet branch
                               and HEAD labels to it (label LABEL stays 
                               behind).
                                                          HEAD
                                                           |
                               LABEL HEAD          LABEL  (D)-MASTER
                                      |                / |          
                                   (B)(C)-*MASTER      (B)(C)
                                    | /         ___    | / 
                                   (A)             /   (A)
                                    |                   |      
                                   ---                 ---    



               RESET -hard HEAD^ - Move current label to commit HEAD-1,
                                   and also do checkout (--hard)


               LOG --graph --decorate --all - Shows nice history with
                                              graph
</code></pre>

<p>TODO graph!        DETACHED HEAD STATE:
                   TAG v1.0 <hash> -> CHECKOUT v1.0 - If no branch label is
                   on this commit you get message: "You are in detached
                   head state", meaning that if you want to keep your
                   commits, you need to create a new branch.</p>

<p>===========================================================================
TO MERGE NEW FEATURE INTO MASTER:</p>

<pre><code>                                       HEAD *LABEL        HEAD LABEL
                                           /                 /

                    1. CHECKOUT       2. MERGE MASTER    3. CHECKOUT MASTER,
                       LABEL             (recursive),       MERGE LABEL
                                         test               (fast forward)</p>

WORKING WITH REMOTE REPOSITORIES:</p>

<pre><code>               CLONE &lt;url or path of origin&gt; &lt;optional different name&gt;
                     - Makes a copy of remote repository. State of our 
                     repo after clone:

+--------------------+----+- TRACKING BRANCHES - they mean: last time I
v ORIGIN/LABEL &lt;-----+    |  talked with origin, thats where its label
</code></pre>

<p>ORIGIN/HEAD | ORIGIN/MASTER &lt;-+  was.
           |/ 
     HEAD--(D)--*MASTER &lt;------- Also it did not pull over LABEL branch,
          / |                    because it pulls over only the default
        (B)(C)                   branch, which is master (note that origin
         | /                     and master are just names, they have no 
        (A)                      segnificance).
         | <br />
        ---    </p>

<pre><code>               CLONE --bare &lt;url or path of origin&gt; &lt;optional different
                     name&gt; - Make a copy of repo, containing only
                             contents of .git directory (there is no
                             checkout.

               REMOTE -v - List remotes (defaultly named origin)

               PULL - Same as FETCH + MERGE

               PUSH &lt;origin&gt; &lt;local branch&gt; - Pushes changes made to the
                                              local branch to origin repo.
