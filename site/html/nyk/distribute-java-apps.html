<h1>DISTRIBUTE JAVA APPS</h1>

<p>DISTRIBUTE JAVA APPS:
1. Just use jar.
2. Use launch4j and an installer like NSIS.
3. Use Webstart.</p>

<h2>4. Use a native-code compiler like Excelsior JET and distribute as a executable, or wrap it up in an installer.</h2>

<p>Java desktop app:</p>

<h2>On Windows this means .exe, start menu links, control panel integration and specific task manager process for example with minimal overhead start time for a small app (still waiting for update 10 here...) and a shiny own icon in the taskbar when they launch it, not a Java icon.</h2>

<p>JNLP / webstart / RCP (eclipse) / InstallBuilder (for adding jre to install)</p>

<h2>If you're building an application atop SWT/JFace/RCP rather than Swing, you can create and run a product build in the Eclipse IDE, which results in an executable, making something like exe4j unnecessary</h2>

<p>Convert Jar file to EXE executable:
JSmooth .exe wrapper (2007)
JarToExe 1.8
Executor
Advanced Installer
LaunchAnywhere
JexePack (Class to EXE)
Launch4j</p>
