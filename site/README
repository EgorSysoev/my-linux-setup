This folder contains webpage for the project.
The webpage is generated by running 'generate-pages' script, which is in scripts directory.
This script first generates markdown pages by combining templates with files in the textfiles directory. Then it  converts the markdown files into html pages, meaning that all the files in markdown and html folders are redundant.
