<h1>Hi</h1>

<p>This is site of my <a href="https://www.github.com/gto76/my-aliases">github project</a> in which I contain mainly my <a href="https://www.github.com/gto76/my-aliases/tree/gh-pages/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>... But among theme there are hiding two textfiles in which I write all the interesting things that I know I'm gonna forget otherwise.</p>

<p>The first one contains short descriptions of various Linux commands:
<a href="page/wtf-man.html">WTF-MAN</a></p>

<p>... and another one other topics, mainly about programming:
<a href="page/nyk.html">NYK</a></p>

<p>Geeks of the universe, unite...</p>
