Hi
==

This is site of my [github project](..) in which I contain mainly my [dotfiles](../dotfiles)... But among theme there are hiding two textfiles in which I write all the interesting things that I know I'm gonna forget otherwise.

The first one contains short descriptions of various Linux commands:
[WTF-MAN](page/wtf-man.html)

... and another one other topics, mainly about programming:
[NYK](page/nyk.html)


Geeks of the universe, unite...
