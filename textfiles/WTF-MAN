AWESOME TERMINAL COMMANDS:
##########################


PACKAGES:

dpkg -l - lists installed packages
apt - skin for dpkg
apt-get	update - update local list of existing packages
		-u dist-upgrade - upgrade (to regularly update put in crontab: apt-get update && apt-get -u dist-upgrade)
		install - also update single package
		autoremove - remove unneeded packages
		remove - remove package, leave configurations
		purge - remove package and its configurations, run apt-get autoremove after, to remove all dependencies that are not needed anymore.
		source <package> - download code
		build-dep <package> - install the build dependencies

		show - get info about package
		policy <package> - show installed and remote version

apropos -a - all keywords
whatis - short description of app
whereis - locates where command resides 
which - similar only executable
wtf - looks up filename suffixes database

HISTORY:

sudo !! - Run the last command as root 
<space>command - Execute a command without saving it in the history
!<term> - last command that starts with term

BASH:

"$x" - ALWAYS PUT DOUBLE QUOTES AROUND VARIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
"$*" - combines all the arguments into single word, separating them with first character of IFS variable. If IFS is not set, space is used. If IFS is null, no separator is used!!!!!!!!! No args provided will result in one empty string being passed on!!! 
"$@" - Use this instead!!!!! Will retain arguments as-is, so no args provided will result in no args being passed on. This is in most cases what you want to use for passing on arguments.
Google: "$@" is right almost everytime, and $* is wrong almost everytime.
"$#" - number of arguments
"$1" - first argument
"$0" - name of the script
$'\n' - string literal with escape seqences
If you want IFS to be a new line (useful with for loop) you need to: IFS=$'\n' - the dollar forces substitution!!!!!
$? - exit code of last command (0 - ok)

test <expression> - same as [ <expression> ], -gt, -d,... Returns zero exit status if true.
	-n - is string non empty, -z - is string empty, -a - and, -o - or,
	= - strings are equal, -nt - file newer than, -ot - older then,
	-d - directory exists, -e - file exists, -f - is a regular file,
	-h - its a symbolic link, -r - has read permission,
	-w - has write permission, -x - has execute permission
[[ <expression> ]] - same as [, but without word splitting and filename expansion. And with additional operators: &&, ||, <, > (lexicographic less, more), and also regular expression matching.
let <expression> - executes expression

$(command) - same as `command`
$RANDOM - 0 - 32767
input=`cat` - getting standard input
- in place of a file name means standard in or out
set -o vi - set line editing to vi mode
pushd . - put current dir on stack
popd - pop dir from stack
cd - - go to last dir
source <script> - run script: for example source /etc/profile (same as . <command>)
#!/bin/bash - good practice to insert at begining of a bash script
export PATH="$PATH:<your-dir>" - add new directory to path variable
All variables in bash are global !!!!!!!
read -p "Press [Enter] key to start backup..." - prompt for user input
variable=${1:-"default value"} - setting variable with default value if $1 is empty

GIT MANTRA:
git init
git add <filename> OR git add .
git status
git commit -am "Commit message goes here."
-
git clone git://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY.git - download repo (later you keep refreshing with 'git pull origin master') -> You need SSH key. If you don't want, use https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORY.git for address.
--
GENERATE SSH KEY:
1. Check for existing keys: cd ~/.ssh; ls -al
2. Generate new key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
3. Add your key to the ssh-agent: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
4. Add your key to GitHub: copy contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and paste them into key field at Acount settings > SSH Keys > Add SSH key.

--
ADD TO GITHUB:
Create remote repository on website
git remote add origin git@github.com:/your-username/project-name.git
git pull origin master
git push origin master
(git push --force)
After your first push, you can simply type:
git push
sometimes also: git push --set-upstream origin master
--
Also useful:
git rm --cached mylogfile.log - untrack file without deleting it.
git tag -a 0.9.1 -m "Version 0.9.1 release" - tag latest commit
git tag - list local tags
sudo chown -R yourname:yourgroup * - in .git/objects
git reset --hard HEAD~1 - delete last commit
git format-patch -1 <sha> - generate patch file
git rev-parse HEAD - get sha of head
git reset --hard <sha> - trash the changes
git reset HEAD^
git revert
git describe - print version and hash of HEAD
--
Remote:
git remote update - get info about state of remote
git status -uno - check if everything up-to-date
git remote show origin - print address of the origin
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:my_user_name/my_repo.git - change the url of origin, ssh key needed
