WTF-MAN
-------
Long list of Unix commands with short descriptions. Useful for quick search before you start googling. In [**`.my_bashrc`**](conf-files/linux/bash/.my_bashrc) there are a few aliases that enable quick access, namely:
* **`m1`** - displays file with the pager
* **`c1 PATTERN`** - searches file for pattern
* **`cc1 PATTERN`** - searches file for command name
* **`v1`** - opens file in vim
* **`n1`** - opens file in nano

INS
---
Describes how to install and set up things on freshly installed Linux (mainly for Debian). This file is a bit redundant since I automatized all this with *preseed.cfg* file and an *install* script, both of which are in [**`DEBIAN`**](conf-files/debian) folder.
