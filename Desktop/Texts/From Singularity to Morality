FROM SINGULARITY TO DUALITY

13:12 15/3/04
Ok...

So Hegel says about basic ordinary Knowing that...

So I lost it. Not enough of a frame for me, but nonetheless, lets not get to pessimistic. If we take into account pursuit of Hegel's philosophy to resolve everything to its end, how come it's still able to posses structure instead of crumbling into itself. I think one must attribute this to the gaps; so this leads us to the foreground/background / chicken or the egg problem; what is more important/what was first: the philosophy/structure/wiesenshaft or the gaps/the incomprehensible.
As interesting and absolute as this problem seems it may be of little importance in itself unless we can render it to something a bit more 'earthly'; for instance: How does it relate to morals/primordial good/evil/... more specifically: can something already go wrong in this domain (rephrase)?
But to return to the notion of crumbling before. When does the philosophy/wiesenshaft begin to crumble into itself; and when it is standing, does it not all the time 'contain' this crumbling(or at least the notion) in itself. Isn't the concept of Now nothing but this crumbling into itself? So the question is how does it manage to remain, the-spite the crumbling which seems to be the essence of it? Well, it must be this unconectable gap between "now" and the last/next "now"; because although they are the same nows, and they stand one by the other, they just cannot be connected/merged/ or a little shifted, because of the notion of greater Now they impose. This notion of Now takes one of them and makes it a subject while other remains the object, and so although they remain the same, the multitude of them makes them different, and thus multiple; and we are back at the chicken and the egg problem. So we get this structure, but without the zero point, without the anchor. It's like if 2D fractals actually have somewhere between 1 and 2 dimensions and if Thought has only one dimension (that of cause and effect), then this structure lives somewhere between 0 and 1 dimension (effect effecting the cause). 
So with this established lets look at how it renders itself in physics. There we get instead of one, two ends of the thread. One micro and other macroscopic: neutrinos and galaxies.. So far, if we look at the material world as less pure then the spirutual (ideological), it makes some sense to have more ends. It also makes sense that the closer we get to the end the purer and at the same time more contradictory the forms get. But the question that poses itself here is: Is there the gap (this is different gap than one between nows) between the end and the forms or do the forms gradually morph into the void? And in the case of the physics will the knowledge (if it is obtainable at the first place) about one end imply the other; and since the is a 'lesser' world, will it tell us anything about the (non)existence of the primordial gap in the philosophical domain.
Of course the last question smells, but lets examine the different possible answers that Physics as such is capable of giving us: Discrete vs continuous basis, Singular vs multiple universes, Infinite vs finite universe, Lack of time vs lack of space at the big bang... So it gets clear pretty quickly that physical explanations of world at its ends automatically includes the spirutual (ideological).
But nonetheless (or because of it), the big question for/on both sides is the existence of the zero point and its relation to the void/non-existence. Is zero point same as void? But how can a point be a void at the same time? Isn't void the opposite of point, no matter from how far we look? If there is no zero point, then why does it seem like everything is pointing toward it?
To get a bit more metaphysical; Isn't the first and the only thing such entity as zero point can "do", to destroy itself by splitting into two parts, which of course cannot anymore be zero points, but one "positive" and other "negative" part of it. But since this jump looks like a necessity isn't it still in a way the zero point. I would say no, because it already incorporates something like a "decision": Which part becomes positive and which negative. This might seem like just a problem of naming things, but from where do we then get this notion of positive/negative. If it is from some later "event" down the line, how was than this primordial jump even possible.. But nonetheless maybe we are moving too fast here, specifically: Even though the primordial entity splits itself into two parts, and by definition this parts cannot be equal, because that would mean the entity multiplied itself, which would be impossible at this stage (because of lack of space for two of them:) and thus it can only split itself into two opposing entities, the "sum" of which is same as that of the entity itself; Nonetheless does the notion that they are opposing already imply that one of them specifically is positive? Maybe, but it certainly dozen't imply which, because they are also the same. Of course here we are already not only in domain of quarks, but also in part that of electrons. Although an electron cannot freely change into a proton; nonetheless the electrons themselves are indistinguishable among themselves - one is totally the same as the other (so it is meaningless to disscuss for instance how any electrons that were once part of Budha on average doess a person contain in its body) - what keeps them in "order" is law of conservation. But again we are moving to fast here. 
We should examine the nature of the two Opposites some more. Precisely their being of the same matter, same ancestor, same cause, conceived at the same moment and still being different, maybe more accurate; being opposite. The question is from where does this concept of opposition stem. Is it already inherent in the Entity itself, or does it somehow emerge by itself from the impossibility of the Entity to "do" anything? Isn't thus the Opposition in opposition to the Entity(in itself/from itself)? The moment it emerges is itself in opposition to the Entity, but since this would mean the surplus, the original Entity must at the same time vanish, thus leaving the Opposition by itself -> what renders the two opposites, but also the opposition in the situation itself (namely parts being the same, but opposite at the same time), which is the real surplus we get from this split/jump. 
A quick and jumpy conclusion from this would be that, thus the wheels are set in motion from the start and the Jump is in it's nature an discrete event and thus the singularity unattainable by gradual deduction. And that the most primordial thing/idea that is accessible to us is that of opposition. And that it would actually enable us to grasp the singularity in it entirety if it wasn't for the opposition that it poses to itself by making the same at same time opposite. This surplus sets the wheel in motion, which makes it impossible to observe the singularity, also because we need the surplus at the first place to observe. -> This of course nicely parallels itself to nirvana experience, in which we have to lose more and more "stuff" until at the end we also have to let go of the observer/observer.

Good and Evil as primordial opposites..

So the question that poses itself here is: What is the connection between good and evil and this two primordial opposites (and their surplus)?
In a way good and evil are the highest abstractions for the humans. We use them to substitute for us what is most important to us, although we always have trouble trying to label "stuff" with one or the other. We are also frequently questioning is it at all possible to bucket stuff this way; nonetheless the notion of Good and Evil is as present as ever. 
So to tackle it systematically, we have basically two possibilities: Are the two Opposites themselves good, because they themselves together alone are the Entity, and the surplus that stems from them evil? (Buddha) Or the other way around? (Judo/Christian - glorification of falling into)
Let's say that we identified the anchor of two different (opposite?) mortalities. How do we then get from this anchor to the other less general rules of morality (10 commandment, Buddhist basic morality,...), which are if we look at the world actually more general and present throughout cultures. Namely: Don't: kill, steal, be greedy, (angry, delusional), lie, slander.. One explanation would be that these rules are helping in maintaining larger societies and thus help in propagating themselves. So they are but the stage for the deepest morality which is one of the primordial ones, namely Buddhas: Don't conduct in sexual misconduct (excessive passion) vs Biblical Thou shalt not commit adultery and Thou shalt have no other gods which of course also serve the cause of propagating and same is with Buddha.
So by accepting this explanation we basically diminish those laws to the simple universal state laws, but at the same time we see between their lines their true meaning, namely taking sides in one of the primordial opposites. Two things of interest arise from here. First is if the majority of morality is strictly utilitarian in sens of trying to propagate itself, how would morality look in a world where opposite actions are necessary for a morality to propagate itself; namely: killing, stealing, lying.. of course inside of community itself. But this is definitely not as interesting problem as next one: __________
Let's take a little detour here and return to the Primordial Entity and its representation in Khmer/Hinduistic temples. It's beautifully represented in the biggest of them Angkor Wat, which represents the complete Hinduistic cosmos in small: Angkor Wat; All the elements of the temple point at the center and what actually is there is a deep hole, namely nothing. In the contrast to to Solomons temple, in center, the Inner House, there was the ark with ten commandments, which were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai: in our terms the excess. Also worth of notion is the most predominant motive of the temples - The Churning of the Ocean of Milk - that is comes from hinduistic creation myth that talks about the game of thug of war between divinities and demons.
__________
But more interestingly, last distinction between essential/primordial part of morality and its utilitarian/reproductional gives us a chance to parallel (them) the two moralities to the two oppositions and their excess. This is getting a little confusing. Again: We have two opposing primordial moralities, and they form the excess which manifests itself in common moralities, which the two share. So if we look from judochristian perspective to this structure, we favor falling in/sticking with them/embracing them, and from Buddhist perspective we try to "acquire dispassion for them". So from both perspectives, (common) moralities stand for a kind of a ladder, the only question is which direction is up, where should we climb? So are we to put them on the altar, embrace them fully again and again, let them shape our existence and follow where it leads us (thus basically abandoning their original context), or should we grow more and more dispassion for them, not abandoning them, but paving our path with them, thus giving less and less thought to them as we move forward with their help?   

Conclusion from above could be: Although the utilitarian moralities might seem like lesser ones comparing to the primordial, they are still moralities and thus in a way indivisible from each other. Although the judo and Buddha moralities are basically leading in opposite ways, it would be hard for one to label another as evil, since evil is supposed to be what lies outside moralities and both share commons which are indivisible from primordial part according to moralities. 
But if we assume both of them to be focused on their path, we can't but notice the very different perspective that is unfolding in front of them. To the Buddhist one, as it is moving along the road paved from basic moralities, the picture of primordial split is becoming ever clearer. And not until one can fully accept this split can one reach nirvana and thus basically abandon the road that let him achieve it. There is of course little need for god in this perspective.
The judochristian perspective, at the other hand, is facing endless road ahead, disappearing in haze. The possibilities for her are endless. Of course from this open position then stem endless controversies such as determinism/free will and god..  
--------------------

A little appendix to the section:
BUDA: More we move this way, less lies outside morality -> we get enclosed by morality itself, but still, to reach singularity we have to cut off the excess, thus staying only with Buddha and Juda, which by this cut become the same. So the perspective before the cut would be very clear view of double opposite moralities.
JUDA: The other way that has no end (it is bodhisattvan by it's nature), it is surrounded by less and less morality, basically soaked in particularities, thus in a way penetrating deeper and deeper into god (void) (party getting out of hand)
Morality is in a way the last thing (frontier) that is of us, what is truly godly is outside morality, the void, the incomprehensible (the Random/ Mr Random). In other way, closing in to nirvana, god, Random, the incomprehensible is of less and less importance.
Thus the evil perceived as "stuff" outside moralities holds in the middle, but further up or down we go, we need a different approach to classification, (just) because of practicality.. In case of Buda side, Juda as evil would make sense, of course up until nirvana (still not answer to what can go wrong in nirvana domain) In case of Juda, almost fully emerged in god..., probably not not embracing more could be sign of evil (but that could also hold for Buda) But better question would be what is good? In a way notion disappears and we HAVE to trust god.

How to explain, by acquired means, the Tibetan position to the question of unnecessarity of morality to reach nirvana, that something can go terribly wrong in nirvana domain itself?
The way to start tackling the problem probably lies in the substitution of words by Zizek, from evil to 'terribly wrong'. It signifies the shift from our "earthly" moralities to some higher, but still maintaining the negative signifier. So instead of asking what could go wrong with nirvana domain, let's ask instead what does it mean for something to go wrong there, or rather what can even go wrong there, or even what can "go on" there? Isn't nirvana suppose to imply stasis?
First paradox here arises, that Zizek is trying to tackle a problem proposed by Tibetan tradition, within a scope of Theravada tradition. Particularly he is suggesting a problem in nirvana domain, but transplanted from a tradition with a different view of nirvana itself. Namely don't Tibetan Buddhist count the Bodhisattvas to be operating in nirvana domain itself. This domain seems different from Theravadean domain of nirvana which although after obtaining it you stay here and nothing changes is in a way purer shift than obtaining it and than returning. Theravadean nirvana thus doesn't leave you an option of getting back, precisely because you didn't went anywhere, where at the other hand one could imagine an Bodhisattva having an possibility of turning back and becoming "evil".

Return to the Primordial Opposites
But of course the question arises: What comes next? Probably: zavest, samozavedanje, um, duh, religija, [absolute knowledge]?
So is there a middle road between Juda and Buda?
So acording to Hegel if we go one level higher from the two religions we come to 'absolute knowledge'

From handwriting:
-The excess then becomes the oposite to opposites.
-TODO Further develop differences and commons between the commandements.
-TODO On which hegelian level are we now (in this discusion)? Morals, religion, enlightened religion or absolute knowledge? 
-What could go wrong with nirvana domain itself:
1. UNDEVELOPED ((Only thing that could possibly go wrong is if there developes a duality in nirvana itself since it is only spirityal exeperience, of course is not physical, what means there is still a bit of excess, [but at this time its the excess of other, namely the excess of the spirit left behind - BLUFFING])) - is Zizek here leaning on lacanian concepts?
2. Or is the problem the spirit that gets left behind? What happens to the spirit when it is abondaned? Does it become absolute knowledge? On the other hand, can only spirit because of its primordiality/spirituality obtain nirvana here and now, meaning obtaining it between the global nirvanas of big bang and big collapse)?
___________
Interesting corespondence of religious thoughts and scientific views of the universe:
1. Infinately expanding universe - Juda
2. Statical universe - Paga(nism)
3. Collapsing universe - Buda
___________
For Zizek absolute knowledge (p48) is lacanian passe: 
The final moment of the analityc process, "The experience of the lack of other" (p27). So in path of Juda this would be an christian enlightenment - The death of god) So the moment god almost takes up completely it dies (the moment we or I atain absolute knowledge) And so through god everything is permited (as long as one of course makes shure this path can be propagated (reproduced for others) -> as long as the framework, "empty" customs mentain -> catholic church / [islam?]
So here seems that juda differs from buda: namely in the necessity of path -> where buda is free to abondon the "path" once it attains the enlightenment (at least in Teravada), to juda the conservation of the "path" after achiving enlightenment seems more important.
UNDEVELOPED But still as absolute knowledge is obtained throug judo enlightenment, it can in a way let go of primordial singularity -> it in a way becomes a new singularity.. where as nirvana is obtained it can let go of all the dualities. - [Here it seams that as I am operating with this absolute concepts still too atachet to the notion of self, as if one point is moving around the field, what can of course be useful analogy when operating around the middle, but as we are approaching extremes, the self is getting under attack.]
Absolute knowledge and nirvana as oposites(dualities).
In a way they don't contradict, thay don't produce excess and thus they succed in what the primordial duality "failed" at, namely creating stable duality (withouth excess)
But another reading could also be that only thogether they compose absolute knowledge?? But this would render juda and buda enlightenment the same, wouldnt it?
One can not attain the absolute absolute knowledge, one that would include absolute knowledge and nirvana together, precisely because they together form the stable duality, one withouth excess. And it is this lack of excess that "prohibits" the continuation of dialectical process, that would lead to next step, namely that of absolute absolute knowledge.

From Why Hegel is a Lacanian - drive against nirvana: Lacanian ethics
Ethic and morality are to be sharply distinguished. Morality is conserned with the symmetry of my relations to other humans; its zero-level rule is 'do not do to me what you don't want me to do to you.' Ethics on the contrary, deals with my consisteny with myself, my fidelity to my own desire.

From Hegel with Lacan: Differentiating absolute knowledge
Relation between knowledge and truth..
Absolute knowledge as abolation of the Other..
One usually understands absolute knowledge as the fanatsy of a full discourse, withouth fault or discord, the fantasy of an Identity inclysice of all divisions, whereas our reading, by way of contrasy, sees in Absolure knowledge the exact opposite of this, the dimension of the reaversing of achieved Identity where for finite consciousness there is only division rather the experience of distance, separation, where for finite consciousness there is only fusion and identity (between object a and the Other). Absolute knowledge, far from filling the lack sensed by 'finite consciousness' sepatated from the Absolute, transfers this lack int the Other itself. The twist introduceed bu absolute knowledge thus concerns the very status of lack: the finire, alienated consciousness suffers from the loss of the object, while de-alienation consists of the realization that the loss of the object, while de-alienation consists of the realization that this obhect was lost from the beginning, and that any given object is simply an attempt to fill in the empty place of this loss.
.. To put it another way, the perspectivel error consists in thinking that at the end of the dialectical process, the subject finally obtains that for which they are searching..
The passe as the final moment of the analytic process does not say that one has finally resolved the impasse, overcoming its obstacles - the passe can be reduced to the retroactive experiance ahet the impasse is already its own 'resolution'. To put it another way, the passe is exactly the same thing as the impasse, just as the synthesis is exactly the same thing as the antithesis: what changes is only the 'perspective', the position of the subjct.

Hegel in femenology 780-784 (830-834 sl) Overcoming of good and evil
780 So hegel in resolved religion talks that in fact what is outside of religion is evil, or course until the religion itself doesent realize that the evil in it self same as goodnes, (and that devie being is seme as nature) .. (reconsiliation of devine being with its other, specificaly with a thought of it- evil. If this reconsiliation is notionaly expressed - .. - if evil is the same as goodnes then evil is just not evil.., both are suspended moments, evil in general is self center being for self and goodnes is what is simpe and without the self.. their unity is at once evident.)
784 Christianity understood in this way leads to the idea that the comming of into existance of the gods individual selfconscusnes as a universal selfconscusness is the same as religious community. God the father and god the san are abstract moments until the emergence of the spirutual community .. comunity is the truth about those two moments... Devine being is a form akin to judging councusnes, acting conscusnes (christ), the mutual reckognition btween them is intuitively aprehanded by religious counscusns as coming of the holy spirit..
787 Although there is a return out of picture thinking in princaple in communal selfreckognition, the community is not yet perfected this itself conscusnes, and that picturethinking steel burdens comunal spirutuality because it is jet to achieve pure thought. The community does not posses the counscusnes of what it is. Substance has here sucseded in becoming absolute selfconscusness, but this remains at other for devotional conscusness. Christian conscusness is simply literaly confused about its own fundamental commitments. It is confused not in sense of having contradictionaly beliefes, but because it expresses those beliefes in representional way, and the crock of this representional way is sometimes said,.. that the content of religion and philosophy are the same only expressed differently - this is essentialy anti hegelian form .. The notion of beond becomes in christianity simply the future - in some indefinate future at the day of judgement we will be resurected, returned and finally united with god. .. The problem is a notion of beyond as the notion of the future. As long as word is waiting the disfiguration, it is not taking the form of the spirit. So what makes the picturethinking inadequate is its temporal schema, an idea of the discrete past present and future, and hence an idea of christian time design in which good selfhood is an past event and an reconsiliation happens in a distant future and the pressent is lost somewhere between manifestation and reconsiliation. What makes representational thought representational is just understanding and therefore to get past representational and become conceptional what we recquire is a different way of thinking about time.
Discrete past, present and future.. we need diferent notion of time and history. .. Eruption of otherness for Hegel must be a wending of a kind which belong to the pain of dismemberment. A rending which no mere selfasertion can heal and hence requires the pacients and the labour of a negative - a working throught of a negative (traumatic history) History we read is hystory of trauma. In this was the femenology is about nothing else than the negative, for it is about nothing else but the various ways in which human beings have positive partiular objects or forms of life as absolute and in each case has come to ruint. It it those ruins that slorvenge which have been our object. .. when i forgive you I already go beyond good and evil. The forgivenes is the denail that the moraliti is oponent. So there is something about forgivenes which is amoral. Rather han acting to evil we let it unfold.. [critique of forgivenes, forgivenes is forgetfunless, and i will not forgive / forgivenes has a standpoint of a analist with respect to analised (dostojevski) -> literature] ..

CHAPTER 2

1.How deep must we fall, before we can turn around and start climbing toward nirvana?
2.Do we attain the Object when we reach nirvana? Or rather do "we" become on Object when we reach nirvana?
3.And how come that the dialectic stops somewhere (at absolute knowledge)? And is there any property in primordial singularity (on it?) that is giving us the clue that the dialectic will have an end? (and does the number of levels have any significance? 5?)
????????????????

Interogating the real:
-Lacan - perspective of last judgement (which formulates the objective meaning to your acts)
-Saying "There us no big other" excludes this perspective (Deiredas infinite justice, forever postponed, always to come, nontheless didnt make thet cut)
-We need thi for trully autonomous ethich.

-Dialectical end: what was initialy percieved as a problem is now seen as it's own solution..
-Zizeks open ended conceptton of dialectics!?!?
-How is hegels method not simly the basis for new master signifier?
-Pvt hegels enlightened religion and its problem with time, where discerning big bang/colapse

A dot on time is line, a line in time is surface, a surface in time is volume, a volume in time is entity > we have 5 levels -> all we need to do now is get rud of time's temporal property, namely getting rid of past, present, future and we atain absolute knowledge.
Of course the dot is not a primordial singularity, even if in space of 0 dimensions, because it poseses its opposite > 0 dimension withouth a dot, namely the dimension itselve. They are in a way primordial dualities, whichs oposition produces excess, they resolve into the 1D space, since only way they can coexist is on a line (in time).
So we could ask here why not 5 dimensions? Does hegels dialectic have 5 levels because we have 5 fingers? Or because we live in 3 dimensions.
[IMAGE OF WORLD AND RELIGIONS]
See how simple things as sunrise/set influence the basis of our beliefe! Namely buda in east, juda in west, and hindu in middle (because india has both east and west shore, and paganism being to local to have any shore, and also tibet having no shore) [is hinduism the all encircling way?] Ko si na obali in gledas proti vzhodu, zahodu, en pogled je, da je bolk prirocno it v isto smer, drugi pa da seve civilizacije jasno vidijo kot center / najbolj razvito, ki je ze skozi tezila v to smer in prisla do obale [[neandertalci so sli v napacno smer:)]], pred nami je samo se veliki skok.

Katera lastnost singularnosti nam sporoca, da se bo dialektika koncala? 
To je verjetno znak prvega stavka: apak vseeno ne tako pesimisticno, kako da se hegklov sistem ne sesuje sam vase. Se pravi je to tisti hakeljc ki smo ga iskali, ne samo absolutno znanje, ki je sama realizacija, ampak opazka, da sploh lahko pridemo do brezoblicne singularnosti do realizacije. Zdi se nelogicno ampak ce prvo odvrzemo cas, ki ga moramo ze za absolutno vedenje, se nam lahko prikaze kot nuja? On the more philosophical level, although that we always expected to discover some "magic" at the end, when we do, it still seams imposible, although that it is in it's purest, unrepresentational form the only way of magic to be, namelu from faceles singularity to ending dialectic. Only other "magicless" way would be for singularity to not explode. So in a way that excess of a jump renders itself in a finity of dialectic. (But we could probably also reverse it: So in a way that jump renders itself in a excess of finity of dialectic). To put it other way, the "magic" of a jump cancels itself with a "magic" of end of dialectic. Since we started with imposibility, isn't the only logical way that we end with one. 
So here we get a new duality, that between the jump and the end of dialectic. But they are not oposite!!! How do they corespond to the duality of singularity and dialectic (probably meant absolute knowledge). They are in a way endpoints, one of singularity and other of (preimordial) duality / dialectic (i should be more precise here), but are also the endpoint of a stasis and of process/antistasis (only that the endpoint of process doesent lead back to primordial singularity, bu to s stasis of a process/form) But the fact is they are not circular. the end of a proces doesent lead back to stasis (true/primordial singularity), nor thus it lead to new process; It just becomes the true (and only possible) opposite of it (primordial singularity). So loss is not percieved as such anymore. [PICTURE]

How deep must we fall, so we can start climbing back toward nirvana?
Simple answer: Deep enough that Buddhism can form. So probably enlightened religion? So all the way to the last step before absolute knowledge (?) So the entry point to enlightenment for both juda and buda is at the same end edge of progress, namely the enlightened religion, only that one offers a step out ant another a slide back into the begining. (refine)

To take it afresh, why is the end of dialectical process essential?
Of course the singularity and duality/absolute knowledge do not posses in themselves the oposite (realy?). For ak, the singularity is list and for singularity the ak is unatainable. They are separated by the jump. So from this distant perspective jump loses it's directionality and becomes just a barrier. (we just happen to find ourselfs on this side) So is the question how did we come here (find ourselfs on this side)? No! The question thet makes sense to us should be: Should we embrace it or escape it (distance ourselfs from it) (the side). So we can look at the two paths (given to individual) as the only true alternatives, that in a way can't produce an sinthesis, and thus as only true ethics. But of course one can choose to follow one half of his life one and the other the second. But not I think, if one folows juda, he in a way never stops; he embraces the embracement and so on.. The moment one stops, and turns around, he becomes unethical.
And when one reaches nirvana, well he statyes in this world, and can teach others and offer them support,but what are his ethics after nirvana?

---
Since we accept the imosibiliti of a jump (went that way), we are forced to accept (we must) the impossibility if a end of dialectic.
_______
Both ways of course require us of letting go of the pictural representation and of notion of present/past/future, thus both ways must let go og a enthics (morals) that require final judgement, or even the ntion of it (even if unatainable). One ethics that can do without it. Well, doesent he who becomes just the observer of a samsara, doesn't he loose ethics as such. Don't ethics only exist in a domain of ak? But when one obtains juda enlightenment, does he step out? No, he is out of enlightened religion, but still inside ak.
So is this level attainable for someone who is trying to reach nirvana?
In a way ethics is all that remains in judo enlightenment (ethics of ethics) (and thus they consume morals) and totaly disapear in buda enlightenment. (In both cases morals are probably the first victim) [So only ethics of the commandements remain at this point, but this is probably one step before the enlightenment] > probably the ethics of juda enlightenment > nirvana as abondonment of ethics > is this eveb bareble for human/spirit > 
Does one abondon spirit too (along with ethics)?

So if we arrived to the end in a spiritual domain, will this render itself as achieving the end in hard sciences too, namely physics? Will we finaly suced in getting rid of time? And will it not lead us to the same end as philosophy, namely thefinding of the magic, but that magic being the only possible one, so in a way a bit of dissapointment for us. Will it not lead us to the duh.. moment. (Like what did you expect? Something to end, and not be magical at the same time?) But lets dwell a little more here. How specificaly whould that be stated in phisics?
So the magicality of a center/big bang requires a magicality of its edge/end/finity. The universe can not be infinite, or at least have infinite mass/energy. [where do infinite universes fit?] As effect withouth a cause the impossibillity of a jump(big bang) realizes the impossibility of a finite mass/energy and the impossibility of a finite mass/energy requires an impssibility of a jump/big bang. (as what is then on the other side of an edge of universe?)

And since big bang and big collapse are from a distant perspective, withouth a temporal dimension, basicaly the diferent manifestations of the same thing, namely the primordial jump/gap, we are only left with two concepts: gap and here (universe) and thus singularity is forever lost for us, but the loss enabled our existance, so we get at least that :)
So the wrong way of predicting what that would manifest itself in phisics is that the system (of equations) is the singularity we were looking for, although we will never find the missing part of equation, because it doesent exist, so in a way we will be forced to put in a most imminent spot of a final wquation one blank variable (lambda, one that can be substituted with any equation, thus also with itself.), and thus we will conclude the circle; Finish and conect the sistem.
(That would probably stand from Bach/godels perspective, but not from Hegels. But even from his/theirs perspective, arent fractals bounded on one side; they have surface (at least some), are not infinately big; they only have infinite edge.. Bach/godels as hegel for the anglosaxons.. Do they think the path is infinite?) But this would probably mean the endless recursion and thus endless dialectic. More hegelian would be stance, that we will find the last equation, but that alone will imply, that something must have been left out. We still won't be able to explain big bang/collapse, but this exactly will require big bang/colapse to have happened, this will be it's explanation.
So to put it in a way less dramaticaly: One can't get a big bang/collapse withouts a closed sistem of equations, and one can not get closed system of equations withouth a big bang/collapse. 
[question that still stands is how come did this equations and system become so balanced]
Both are irregularities, that "cancel" each other out, or better constitute the underlying composure that both sides need [articulate], although they are entirely separetad.
So even singularit in a most primordial sense needs (or already poseses in its self) our universe, although it may seem selfsuficient. 
[So the question that remains is: Why do we then percieve singularity as selfsuficient?] So to put it simply, we are to accept the impossibility of true/stable primordial singularity. [Are we? What about nirvana?] Is not nirvana as such, obtaining this or at least some singularity?
Science:
So will not equation at the end connect (make sense), but their exclusion of a big bang/cllapse will not make sense, so we will get that it was lost from begining [big if]
Magic:
At the end when we find it, isn't that act of finding it exactly the magic itself, and thus the only imaginable way of finding one. More precisely, the magic that we find is not the object (singularity) itself, but the fact that we are able to accept, that it was lost from the beggining. The possibility of our search ending withouth finding it is what is magical (or the actual magic) and inconprehensible.
So in a way that two magics are then in a way true duality, one in which singularity tried to split itself into, but failed. True (stable) dualities in sense thatt they are oposite, but not opposing, the true two faces of a coin, that do not generate excess. So in some way they are the two bounds of our world. (In physics finite time and finite space, or better that of micro and macro) So on one side magic of the gap bounds us from the singularity/object and at the other the magic of atainability of absolute knowledge bounds us from the infinite other, from the void. (So in a more physical language big bang preventing matter to get infinately small (disappearing) and a sistem of equations/laws, preventing matter to be infinate) If this bound would be missing and the equations would not be closable, it would mean our universe would be a fractal..
So with an act of splitting, singularity suceedes in bounding itself (buying herself structure, for the price of substance) Although she was self sufficient, she was missing structure, and although we have structure, we are missing substance. So in a way she exchanged her being/essence/center for structure, she turned herself inside out, got rid of a substance. (Like Johnson sells its soul to the devill for the sucess; changes his substance for structure)
Religion not seing itself as the other "magical" boundry. [PICTURE] Two magical boundries (that are of the same), which give rise to structure withouth substance; the onion.
So to put it very simplisticaly, we are at the problem of figure ground, and singularity changes from a dot to enclosing space, where structure is posible, but eveven more simplisticaly and maybe acurately: a dot that is not in space and thus initself [PICTURE], voids itself, by becoming a circle (shape without surface), and thus with loosing its surface enables a structure to emerge initself [isnt this pictural thinking?]. But even more mathematicaly correct, a dot (not a sphere) expands itself into a circle in one step (what is morphologicaly imposible; It should first become a line, which then conects its ends - that way former analogy is better) [PICTURE]

magic:
So the solution that would not require a magic would be one of recursion, namely that electrons would be just a little planets, and so on (universe of infinite detail and size), and since this is not true, we absolutely need litle "magic". So this "magic" is precisely the magic of pissibility of primordial jump and that of possibility of absolute knowledge, which are two sides of a coin. So through the magic of absolute knowledge/end of dialectic, we realize the magic of primordial jump/gap, that it really happened. So singularity exchanged it's infinity that it possesed, for structure. So it seized to be total, for the abylity to be creative. [Here we look at it trough form of a story; of course more singular/absolute way of looking at it would be that, singularity alreaty poseses in it's essence structure] [but it also probably bounds itself with time; but this seams a little high price to pay for a jump - it would be ok if it would endlesly expand and contract, so to give some dynamic structure to it]
Which religions/believes do not have the end of time? That would explain an unergensy to go either way on the leather.
So the magic of the jump implies, that there exists the smallest "object" "under" which there is nothing
So the circularity of a universe (time) seems the only logical system in which we don't "bound" time, but still mantain its temporal/action giving component. 
And out of this course comes big question: Can we cheat it? Can we influence in any way the next cycle? [a bit too sifi, but also maybe not relavant?] Are we ourselves (our cycle) a product of this cind of cheating? But more importantly, what would this "cheating"/gluing together/transcending of the cycles mean for the time and universe itself?
And if there can not be any influence, does this mean that all the cycles are exactly the same (that would be kind of disapointing :( Of corse here rises the question of determinism: Are all cycles the same or do they take up all possible (stable) forms? [Tha later way gives rise to interesting parerel to quantum phisics: So in a way we have free will, but looking at the big picture, our choice ends up just as a part of a graph of normal distribution. So in a way it is nown beforehand how regularly your act will occur, only it was not known that it will happen precisely in this cycle. Or better: we will choose one way and thus have free will as long as there exists an observer, otherwise our acrions will spread nicely trough specter - we will choose both ways simultaneously (if we reduce choice to two paths). The question that of course remains is are we enough of a observer to count:) ]
[[why does so frequently when one tries to blacken other religion and believe his; he sounds like someone is making a joke? Trolling for the fun of trolling. Nature of trolling; Oposing for the sake (fun) of oposing. Troll as agent withouth substance, withouth its own position - position shifts depending on a debate, and is always anti.]]

Space:
So the space (void, other) itself can be ifinite, but it doesent mater to us as long as mass/energy/structure [ak] is. 

How do two enlightened guys, one buda, other juda, look at eachother? Buda: Let it be.


From interogating the real - why is hegel lacanian:
In the domain of knowledge, we encounter this logic of separation when, all of a sudden, we see that what we thougt was the limitation of out knowledge about the thing is in fact an inherent limitation of the thin itself. Recall Adorno's analysis of the antagonistic character of the notion of society. In the social sciences, the notion of society oscilattes between two extremes. Either we conceive of it in terma of Anglo-Saxon individualistic-nominalism, as a composite of ineracting individuals as the only really existing agents, or else we adopt a more Continental perspective, exemplified by the work of Emile Durkheim, and conceive of society as an organic Whole, a totality that pre-exists idividuals. The atagonism is here irreducable, and we seem to be dealing with a true Kantian antinomy (the existence of two mutually exclusive, vontradictory even, claims that are both equally justified) which cannot be resolvedthrough any higher dialectical synthesis: society as such cannot but appear as a Thing-in-itself, forever out of grasp of our cognitive capacities. However, as a different approach, one should merely observe the way that this radical antinomy, which seems to preclude our access to the Thing, is already at work in the Thing itself: the fundamental feature of today's society is the irreconcilable atagonism between social totality and idividuals. What first appeared as the sign of our inability to understand what society really is tutns out to be the fundamental feature of social reality itself. That is to say, initially, we were 'alienated', our limited knowledge prewented us from achieving a notion of society; then, in a properly dialectical reversal, this limitation proved to indicate the antagonism of society as such.
Buddhist Ethics: In the Gnostic mode, for Buddhism, ethics is ultimately a question of knowledge and ignorance: our craving (desire) - our attachment to terrestrial goods - is conditioned by our ignorance, so that deliverance comes from proper knowing. What Christion love means is that, on the contrary, there is a decision not grounded in (true or false) knowledge- Christianity thus breaks with the entire tradition of the primacy of knowledhe that spans from Buddhism through gnosticism to Spinoza.
Buddhism/Psychoanalisis/Hegel: In what , then, does the gap that forever separates psychoanalysis from Buddhism consists? In order to answer this question, e should confront the basic enigma of Buddhism, its blind spot: how did the fall into samsara, the Wheel of Life, occur? This question is, of course, the exact opposite of the stabdard Buddhist concern: how can we break out of the Whel of Life and attain nirvana? (This shift is homologours to Hegel's reversal of the classic metaphysical question, how can we penetrate through false apperances to their underlying essentil reality? For Hegel, the question is, on the contrary, how has apperance emerged out of reality?) The nature and origin of the impetus by means of wich desire, its deception, emerged from the Boid, is the great unknown at hte heart of the Buddhist edifice: it points toward an act that 'braksr the symmetry' within nirvana itself and thus makes something appear out of nothing (another analogy with quantum physics, with its notion of braking the symmetry). The Freudian answer is drive: wat Freud calls Trieb is not, as it may appear, the Buddhist Wheel of Life, the craving that enslaves us to the world of illusions. Drive, on the ontrary, goes on even when the subhect has 'traversed the fantasy' and broken out of the illusory craving for the (lost) object of desire.
Death drive/nirvana principle: This is wat Lacan aims at when ke empasizes tha difference between the Freudian death dive and the so-called 'nirvana principle', acording to which every life system tends toward wquilibrium, the lowest level of energy, and ultimately toeard death. 'Nothingness" (the void, being deprve of all substance) and the lowet level of enrgy paradoxically no longer coincide; it is 'cheaper' (it cost the system less energy) to persist in 'something' than to dwell in nothng', at the lowest level of tension, or in the void, the dissolution of all order. It is this distance tht sustains the death drive (i.e. drive as such, since as Lacan puts it, 'every drive is virtualy a death drive'): far from being the same tension, the longing for return to original nothingness), death drive is the tension that persists and insists beyond and against the nirvana principle (the sriving toward the  dissolution of all tension, the longing for return to original nothingness), death drive is the tension that persists and insists beyond and against the nirvana principle. In other words, far from being opposed to the pleasure principle, tne nirvana principle is its highest and most radical expression. In this precise sense, death drive stand for its exact opposite, for the dimension of the 'undead', of a spectral life that insists beyond (biological) death.
Islam: Thus us why psychoanalysis is firmly entrenched in the Western Judeo-christian tradition, as opposed, not only to Orientl spirituality, but also the Islam - one of the religions of the Book, which , like Oriental spirituality, endorses the notion of the ultimate vanity, illusory nature, of every object of desire.
Lacan: Mantaining the gap that forever sepaates every emirical ('pathological') object of desire from its 'impossible' object-cause whose place must remain empty? Is not what Lacan calls 'symbolic castration' this very gap which reners every emorocal object unsatisfctory?
Lacan: Absolute Knowledge is not accomplishd symbolization.
Crusades: In order for us to experience the spiritual truth of Christianity one must first occupy the tomb and then ecperience its emptiness - it is only through this disappointment, through this failure-in-triumph, that one gains insight into how, in order to -live in Christ; one does not have to go far away and occupy empty tombs, since Christ is already here whenever there is love between his followers.

CHAPTER 3

Does Jump/end duality corelate to singularity/absolute knowledhe duality? What is their relation? Probably they are figure ground. [Develop it further!]jump-end = big bang/colapse-micro/macro barier.
1. Get rid of time: bang = collapse
2. So we get three: bang/collapse, micro, macro
3. Other: space + time
4. Absolute knowledge: final mass/energy + finite cycle

SIMPLISTIC:
So since we live in a physical world, which is lesser than the spiritual, wehave two others, and thus four bariers, two for every other.
PROBLEMATIC:
So bang/collapse are of the same, but micro/macro are not. (We could probably still have finite mass with infinite detail, and infinite mass withouth infinite detail.) But with time: time withouth end and time withouth beginig eqal in length to time withouth both. They are all infinite.
[PICTURE]
So how does this two corespond? (singularity and ak vs jump and end)

How did we get time? [It seems mandatory for thing to happen, but still] We don't need it in spiritual world. It seams rational that we need it, but from where did this "extra" dimenson came? [From where did any dimension come? From dialectic?] 
----
Zizek talks about symetry within nirvana... So nirvana is not obtaining primordial singularity of course, but primordial dualiti!!! Duh. So a state without a counsonce.
