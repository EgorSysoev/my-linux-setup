my-aliases
==========

My own .bash_aliases and a list of interesting linux commands.

Besides a lot of useful aliases, there are also a some interesting functions, such as:

*catOrLess - Opens either cat or less, depending on size of input data. Works with files or input stream.

*pingAll - Pings gateway, 8.23.224.10 and www.google.com.

*ip1 - What's my internal ip.

*ip2 - What's my external ip.

*noh - How many people are on network beside you (number of hosts).

*nbaScoreboard - Prints todays nba games.

*nbaStandings - Prints nba standings.

*weathr <city id> - Weather report. Needs city ID -> Go to yahoo weather, search your location, and copy its id from addresbar.

*spilej <artist/song/album..> - Plays a track. First looks in pwd, then runs locate, to search whole filesistem. At the end it tries to find it on Youtoube and download the video and convert it to audio and play it. Most of the problems occur at search phase.
