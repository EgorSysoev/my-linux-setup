my-aliases
==========

My own .bash_aliases and a list of interesting linux commands.
Besides a lot of useful aliases, there are also a some interesting functions, such as:

*www - Traceroutes all countries, prints locations of servers on path. 

*spilej <artist/song/album..> - Plays a track. First looks in pwd, then runs locate to search whole file system. At the end it tries to find it on YouTube and download the video and convert it to audio and play it. Most of the problems occur at search phase.

*catOrLess - Runs either cat or less, depending on size of input data. Works with files or input stream.

*weathr <city id> - Weather report. Needs city ID -> Go to yahoo weather, search your location, and copy its id from address bar.

*noh - How many people are on network beside you (number of hosts).

*ip1 - What's my internal ip.

*ip2 - What's my external ip.

*pingAll - Pings gateway, 8.23.224.10 and Google.

*gi <phrase> - Downloads small google image of phrase.
